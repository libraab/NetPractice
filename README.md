Step 1)- Clear all the sections that you can clear.

Step 2)- In order to comunicate with each other A1 & B1 must have the same netmask and close ip addresses (same for C1 & D1).

  So we're gonna give to A1 the ip address that comes right after (or before) B1 ip address.
  
  If the ip address that comes before doesn't work that means it is not assignable, try the ip address that comes after.

Ps: an ip addr is not assignable cause it's already taken by either the network or the broadcast.

Step 3)- Same with C1 & D1, we're gonna give to D1 the ip address that comes right after or before C1 ip address.

step 1)- Clear all the sections that you can clear (step 1 will be the same in all the levels, I highly recommend to do it that way).

Step 2)- Computer 'A' needs to comunicate with computer 'B'; so they must have the same mask and close ip addressses (same as level 1).

Step 3)- The netmasks of Computer C & D are already the same; 30 is another way to write 255.255.255.252.

  Now we need to give them close ip adresses (such as 20.0.0.1 & 20.0.0.2).
  
  Ps : Doesn't work with ip starting with 10 (cause they're private addr).

Step 1)- Clear all the sections that you can clear. Let's start on clean sheet.

Step 2)- Host A, B and C are in the same network (they are linked to each other), give them all the same mask.

Step 3)- Give Host C & B close ip addresses to Host A ip addr.

(if the 2 ip addresses that comes after doesn't work try the 2 that comes before).

Step 1)- Start on clean sheet; clear all the sections.

Step 2)- Here we have a router, don't panic (it's kinda box of entrances and exits), in this level it's useless but for the next levels we're gonna have to tell what entrance and exit to take.

step 3)- We can put any netmask here except a mask over /29 (why? cause with /30 for example you can only afford 2 ip addresses).

The smaller the mask the larger range of ip it will give you but let's not be greedy and let's put /29 just what we need.

Now, give to each device an ip close to A1 ip.

step 1)- Start on clean sheet.

step 2)- Give the same netmask to R1 & A1.

step 3)- Give the same netmask to R2 & B1.

step 4)- In the left section of the Client B routes there is the word "default". Put the same in Client A routes (in the left section of course).

step 5)- In the right section of Client B routes, put the ip of R2.

step 6)- In the right section of Client A routes, put the ip of R1.

Step 7)- Give to B1 an ip close to R1's ip and to A1 an ip close to R2's IP. (...255 and ...127 won't work cause they're already taken).

(It's like telling the computer "if you don't find what you're looking for, by default go there, and look for it").

-------------
step 1)- Start on clean sheet.

step 2)- Put "default" in all the left section of blue boxes except for Internet (cause The internet is special).

step 3)- Netmask of A1 has to be the same of R1's mask.

step 4)- R1 must have a close ip to A1's ip. Put R1's ip in the right section of client A.

step 5)- In the left section of Internet put the network address of A1; how? by replacing the last digits by 0) then add a mask of /24 (if you wonder why /24, because it's convenient.

                                                     * L E V E L (7)
-------------
step 1)- Start on clean sheet.

step 2)- If you already have "0.0.0.0/0" at the left section of the routes keep them("0.0.0.0/0" or "default" are the same).

step 3)- Here we have 3 networks; R11 & A1 are linked and must be in the same network, same for R12 & R21, same for R22 & C1.

Since for each network we only have two devices we can use a mask of /30 (that give us a range of only 2 ip addresses which is enough).

By using a small range we avoid mistakes or intefering in others networks.

If we use a mask that gives you a larger range we'll have to do some math and binary shit, if you already know how to do this be my guest and get the f out of this tuto for dummies.

So put a mask /30 for everyone.

step 4)- A1 must have the ip that comes right after R11 ip.

step 5)- Put for R21 the ip that comes BEFORE R12 ip. (IPs that ends up with 255 are never assignable).

step 6)- For R22 & C1 we can put 20.0.0.1 & 20.0.0.2

step 7)- Now let's take care of the routes; put R11's ip in the right section of client A :dev.non-real.net.

step 8)- Put R22's ip in the right section client C :accounting.non-real.net.

step 9)- When you have 2 routers linked to each other, in order to connect them we have to give to each of them the ip of the other;

so put R12's ip in the right section of router R2 and put R21's ip in the right section of router R1.

-------------
Step 1)- Start on clean sheet.

Step 2)- The first goal tells us that client C needs to communicate with client D; that means C1, D1, R22 and R23 need to be in the same network.

Let's give them the same mask, which means 255.255.255.240.

Step 3)- Put default in all the left sections of the routers.

Step 4)- Before going to fill the IP's, let's notice that this level impose on us a specific network already put in the left section of the internet.

That means that all the devices will have to be in this network in order to have access to the internet.

The address network is 155.55.62.0 and the mask is /26.
 
If you go on an IP calculator (just google it) and put the network address and the mask if gives you a range of assignable IP specific to this network.

Of course you're not allowed to use this site during evaluation, unless your evaluator is your cousin and he'll close his eyes to that.

Ok this level is the most tricky one. Let's try to achieve a goal at a time.

Goal (1) --> First goal: meson needs to communicate with ion.
- Start on clean sheet.
- B1 (ion) & A1 (meson) & R11 are in the same network. Give them the same mask as R11.
- Give to B1 & A1 & R11 the following IP (20.0.0.1 & 20.0.0.2 & 20.0.0.3).
- Put "default" in the left sections of ion & meson's routes.
- Put R11's IP in the right section of ion & meson's routes.
Click on check again to see if goal 1 is achieved.

Goal (2) --> cation needs to communicate with gluon.
